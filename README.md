Machine learning-based prediction of the production of volatile compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that mimics the meat aroma


The large-scale production of meat poses significant environmental and health challenges, necessitating the development of sustainable and healthy alternatives. This study leverages machine learning (ML) to predict and optimize the production of volatile compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mimicking the meat aroma. By compiling structured data on volatile compounds from canned meat and fermented products under various conditions, ML models were employed to predict key volatile compound yields, simulating meat flavor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The research framework involved data generation and preprocessing, feature selection, model construction, and evaluation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for data quality control, while embedding-based feature selection identified critical volatile compounds. Classification models, including Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were used to predict meat aroma, and regression models quantified the yields of important compounds. The GBDT model demonstrated superior performance, effectively predicting the production of flavors resembling canned meat. This study provides theoretical guidance for simulating meat flavor using fermentation processes, offering a promising approach for plant-based meat flavoring.
